trackwatch
==============

An all-purpose track and field stopwatch app that can be used by a coach to 
oversee track workouts and races, simultaneously handling multiple 
training groups or multiple athletes in a race.

Uses GtK;
The idea is to optimize this for a linux phone such as Pinephone or Librem 5
running a GNOME. 

So far, a basic stopwatch that stores laps is implemented.

Goals:
- Store lists of athletes
- Store completed events: workouts or races
- Set up races or workouts in advance of actually executing them
- Share (via SMS or email) race reports: either everyone's splits or 
an individual athlete's splits.
